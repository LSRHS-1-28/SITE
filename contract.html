    <h1>Contract</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  </br>
  <p class="serif"> I, Jackson, understand that I will be given my own personal website.</br>
     I understand that anything I post on this site can be accessed and</br>
      seen on any computer connected to the World Wide Web. While in this class I will use the web responsibly. Anything I post on my site will contain only content appropriate for the L-S Web Server. No profanity, explicit material, material related to drugs or alcohol, or hateful content will ever appear on my L-S website. The content of my page will not be plagiarized. Any content taken from another digital or non-digital source and used in my website will be directly and clearly attributed to the source within the text of any webpage in which the content appears.</br>
       My ability to abide by this contract will be partially reflected in my Web Publishing course grade. </br>
       I understand that any breach of this contract may have disciplinary ramifications.
Signed,
Jackson
