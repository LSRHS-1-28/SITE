        <h3> Witnessing Citizenship</h6>
          <p> I think one the most recent acts of good citizenship was with the recent hurricane in texas.
            People went out of there way to rescue strangers that were trapped in deadly flood waters. This is
            a great example of good citizenhip because they are going above and beyond the call of duty. </p>
