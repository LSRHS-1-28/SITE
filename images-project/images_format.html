    <h3>Image Formats</h3>
    <div class="topnav">
    <a href="index.html">Images</a>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p> I will be going over the following formats</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>JPEG</li>
      <li>PNG</li>
      <li>GIF</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>A jpeg is a type of photo best used for more complex details. If you were to add shadow or a gradient effect
        this would be your best choice if you were to photoshop something</li>
        <li> a png is a photo type that has different formats inside of it like png 8 or png 24. it is good for transparent photos and keeping the quality the same</li>
        <li> gifs are tricky because they dont have many choices in terms of colors. gifs can also be used to create a moving image. or a "live" photo. it would not be a good format for photoshop</li>
      </ul>
